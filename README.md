# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project will attempt to take raw data downloaded from Kickstarter into an Excel spreadsheet and organize, filter, sort, and visualize that data into an easier to read set of worksheets.

### Purpose
The purpose of this effort is to show Louise the information from how previous crowdfunding efforts fared, as well as provide streamlined data points to aid in building her own crowdfunding project for the play Fever. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The data set provided, while large in scope, was limited in specific details. A general analysis of how each campaign fared can and has been done. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

There can be an argument made regarding a specific time of year a campaign should be executed. While no outcome is guaranteed, there is a trend that supports a campaign being executed in the summer months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data suggests that there is a clear limit for the expected goal of a theater campaign. A far greater amount of successful campaigns were just below the $10,000 threshold. As the goal for the campaigns increased beyond that, the likelhood of failure increased.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Conclusion 1: Successful Theater campaigns fare better between the months of April and September, with a peak in July. ![image_name](C:\Users\jclar\OneDrive\Desktop\Analysis Projects\Crowdfunding Analysis\Resources\THeater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).

Conclusion 2: The number of failed campaigns remains farely constant throughout the year, but never exceed the successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

As the goal of the campaign increases, the percentages of successful campaigns goes down. A reverse trend of an increase of failed campaigns is seen as the goal for the campaign increases. Campaigns with a goal of less than $20,000 have a greater than 50% chance of succeeding. For example, there were 673 successful campaigns betwen $1,000 to $19,999. After that range, the likelihood of the campaign failing increases.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset is limited to Goals and amount pledged. There are little to know details regarding how the campaign was marketed or how the funds received from the goal would be budgeted.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could chart the Average Donations derived from the Kickstarter Data Set. We could also provide more queries abotu the amount of time the campaigns ran for.
